        Finalized setting up API key on local disk space using the .gitignore (committed) and config.env (local only) files. 
        Tested API and printed out sample on tinker.py.
        Added in notes for this on the 'read_me.txt' file for others to copy and easily use without showing API key publicly.

        Items Added:
        - .gitignore
        - config.env (local only)
