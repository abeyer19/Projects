        Finalized setting up API key on local disk space using the .gitignore (committed) and config.env (local only) files. 
        Tested API and printed out sample on tinker.py.
        Added in notes for this on the 'read_me.txt' file for others to copy and easily use without showing API key publicly.

        Items Added:
        - .gitignore
        - config.env (local only)

        Added in a search.py file to start seperating out tasks. Able to put in search perameters such as query, type, and output limit for more customizable searches. To be used later in production once direction is given towards what data to pull daily in cron.
        Updated main.py to stage new files for searches, channels, videos, etc.
        Updated tinkering to start looking into categories, was able to find category ID's for a new search perameter in search.py.

        Items Added:
        - search.py

    --= 5/2/2025 - 18:27 =---
        Added in an api_connection file for api connection call and a categories file for pulling current YouTube categories for database table.
        Refined the search function to be dynamic between type - either video or channel, specifying datatypes and allowing for some arguments that are passed through the function to be ignored when needed.

        Items Added:
        - api_connection.py
        - categories.py
