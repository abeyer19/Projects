        Finalized setting up API key on local disk space using the .gitignore (committed) and config.env (local only) files. 
        Tested API and printed out sample on tinker.py.
        Added in notes for this on the 'read_me.txt' file for others to copy and easily use without showing API key publicly.

        Items Added:
        - .gitignore
        - config.env (local only)

        None

    --= 4/30/2025 - 21:01 =--
        Added in a search.py file to start seperating out tasks. Able to put in search perameters such as query, type, and output limit for more customizable searches. To be used later in production once direction is given towards what data to pull daily in cron.
        Updated main.py to stage new files for searches, channels, videos, etc.
        Updated tinkering to start looking into categories, was able to find category ID's for a new search perameter in search.py.

        Items Added:
        - search.py

    --= 5/2/2025 - 18:27 =---
        Added in an api_connection file for api connection call and a categories file for pulling current YouTube categories for database table.
        Refined the search function to be dynamic between type - either video or channel, specifying datatypes and allowing for some arguments that are passed through the function to be ignored when needed.
        Added in a collector_video.py file to seperate the data collection outside of search.py, which only includes basic search features for metadata such as title and id of videos and channels.
        Added in collector_channel.py file to seperate the data collection outside of search.py, which only includes basic search features for metadata such as title and id of videos and channels.

        Been on vacation for the past two weeks with no computer access.
        Working on developing out the database in PGAdmin4 and understanding out to use a Python library of my choice to connect to PostgreSQL server and do the ETL process.
        Spent 4 hours trying to uninstall and reinstall PGAdmin4 to start from scratch, will need to find a new PostgreSQL server host or create a new user on my computer for projects.

    --= 6/1/2025 17:42 =--
        Finalized the database creation, but needed to create a new user on my Mac then download PGAdmin4 through Homebrew. I could not find out where the PG conf file was with the password for the application, therefore I         could not replace my password for the admin of PGAdmin4 and create new databases.

    -= 6/3/2025 21:34 =--
        Updated documentation and added more folder file structure.
        Added config.env file so it is already downloaded when copying repository.

        Items Added:
        - config.env
