I will write what this is after sudo code is done...

This project is meant to teach myself the ETL/ELT process through web scraping practices using python, database creation and management, and dashboarding capabalities to provide realtime data insights.

I am using different YouTube API web scrapers through BrightData (https://brightdata.com/products/web-scraper) to gather information about one of my favorite learning and entertainment tools.

I hope to finally learn and show people that I am capable of creating a database, extract data using webscrapers, transform and load data into a database, maintain and optimize the database, create realtime dashboards, provide meaningful insights gracefully.
