This project is meant to teach myself the ETL/ELT process through web scraping practices using python, database creation and management, and dashboarding capabalities to provide realtime data insights.
I am using the YouTube API web scrapers through Google (https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) to gather information about one of my favorite learning and entertainment tools.
I hope to finally learn and show people that I am capable of creating a database, extract data using webscrapers, transform and load data into a database, maintain and optimize the database, use cron scheduling for command prompt scripting, create realtime dashboards, provide meaningful insights gracefully.


Set up for Cloning Repository and using Google API key:
1. Create Google API Key for YouTube_v3
2. Clone repository on local disk
3. Create 'config.env' file in local disk directory 
    a. open terminal
    b. cd path/to/your/directory
    c. type in -> echo "API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > config.env
    *IMPORTANT -- .env file is not called config.env, github will not ignore when making any commits to your repository*
