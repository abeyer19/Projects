1. Collect data from YouTube using Google (https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) on channels and videos.
    a. Channel data; name, id, sub count, view count, category, current date and time
    b. Video data; name, id, channel name, tags, view count, comment count, date and time originally posted, current date and time

2 Schedule a cron bash script to grab data every _nth time.

3. Load into PGAdmin4 (PostgreSQL) database and perform ETL/ELT where necessary.

4. Develop a live dashboard connected to PGAdmin4 database and have live alarts to try and finding videos that are blowing up quickly.
    a. I want to be able to see what channels/videos blow up quickly that don't necessarily have a large following and viewership already (150% viewership or subscribership increase).
    b. -- Could greatly decrease the time between bash runs to see ones that are blowing up quickly within the same day?
        i. -- Develop further by looking at similar title names or tags?

5. When jumps occur, flag and load into PGAdmin4 database table for big jumpers.
    a. Need to be above the 150% viewership or subscribership threshold.
