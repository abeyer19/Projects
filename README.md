# Projects
Repo for personal projects I felt like doing.

1. SQL - Auto Create Table for CSV's
- Python script for easily converting CSV files into PostgreSQL code that will create a table in pgAdmin4, rather than going and filling out each column and data type one by one, or typing the code out yourself and similarly doing the same thing stated in the former.

2. ELT/YouTube
- Use API tools to extract data from Google's YouTube v3 API, develop and maintain a PGAdmin4 PostgreSQL database, develop ETL/ELT pipelines to push data from API into the database, and link the database to a query/dashboarding tool for visualizations. *See documentation in 'ETL/YouTube' folder for more in depth ideas around custom functions and API connections, analysis, patch notes for project timeline, and read_me.md for replicability.*
