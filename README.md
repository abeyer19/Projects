# Projects
Repo for personal projects I felt like doing.

1. SQL - Auto Create Table for CSV's
- Python script for easily converting CSV files into PostgreSQL code that will create a table in pgAdmin4.

2. ELT/YouTube
- Use API tools to extract data from Google's YouTube v3 API, develop and maintain a PGAdmin4 PostgreSQL database, develop ETL/ELT pipelines to load data from API into the database, and link the database to a query/dashboarding tool for visualizations and data insights.  \
*See README.md documentation in '[ETL/YouTube](https://github.com/abeyer19/Projects/tree/474b0ccaccfe14f3d36f00f5a22ff16001dfff01/ETL)' folder for more in depth ideas around custom functions, analysis, patch notes for project timeline, and steps for replicability.*
