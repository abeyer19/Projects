# Projects
Repo for personal projects I felt like doing.

1. SQL - Auto Create Table for CSV's
- Python script for easily converting CSV files into PostgreSQL code that will create a table in pgAdmin4, rather than going and filling out each column and data type one by one, or typing the code out yourself and similarly doing the same thing stated in the former.
